Number of files to be analysed: 100
Input files for Hessian calculation will be created
**Average material greyscale (used for calibration of the Hessian output) [avgmat]: 36500
**Conservative threshold for clear fractures [consthresh]: 25700
**Maximum material greyscale; to exclude bright spots [maxmat]: 43000
Padding turned off
The Hessian calculations will be performed
**Hessian calculations for Gaussian kernels from 2 to 5 , with stepsize 1
**Size of analysis blocks (Hessian): 47
The results of the Hessian calculations on various Gaussian kernels will be combined
**Hessian calculations to be included in final output: Gaussian kernels from 2 to 5 , with stepsize 1
